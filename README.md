# CNC/MCT Analytics Dashboard Demo

Portfolio demo for a CNC/MCT equipment analytics dashboard.

This repository is a public, rebuilt demo project. It is not a copy of production source code and does not include real database connections, customer data, equipment history, server IP addresses, credentials, logs, certificates, or private environment values.

All future demo data will be synthetic sample data.

## Planned Demo Scope

The planned demo will show analytics workflows for CNC/MCT equipment using a local-only stack:

- Equipment utilization
- RunTime / CutTime cutting ratio
- Alarm history
- Machine status distribution
- Daily trend charts
- KPI cards and chart-based dashboard views

## Planned Tech Stack

- Spring Boot API
- React dashboard
- MongoDB
- Python seed script
- Docker Compose

## Planned Local Demo Flow

1. Start local MongoDB.
2. Seed synthetic sample data.
3. Run the Spring Boot backend API.
4. Run the React frontend.
5. Open the dashboard and review synthetic CNC/MCT analytics.

## Sample Data

Generate local synthetic sample data with:

```bash
python scripts/generate_sample_data.py
```

The generated files under `sample-data/` are fake demo records only. They are not copied from real production systems.

## Backend

The Spring Boot backend lives in `backend/` and exposes read-only demo APIs over synthetic MongoDB collections:

- `machines`
- `status_history`
- `runtime_cuttime`
- `alarm_history`
- `daily_summary`

Configuration defaults:

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Server port `8090`
- MongoDB URI `${MONGODB_URI:mongodb://localhost:27017/cnc_mct_demo}`
- CORS origins `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:5173`

Run with the included Gradle wrapper:

```powershell
cd backend
.\gradlew.bat bootRun
```

Or run with an installed Gradle:

```powershell
cd backend
gradle bootRun
```

Build:

```powershell
cd backend
.\gradlew.bat build
```

On startup, the backend imports `sample-data/*.json` into MongoDB only when the target collections are empty. The loader works from either the repository root or the `backend/` directory.

See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) for endpoint details and response examples.

## Local Runtime

Run MongoDB and test the backend locally:

```powershell
docker compose up -d mongo
cd backend
.\gradlew.bat bootRun
```

In a new PowerShell session from the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\test_backend_api.ps1
```

See [docs/RUNTIME_TEST.md](docs/RUNTIME_TEST.md) for the full runtime test flow and troubleshooting notes.

## Security Notice

- Do not add production `.env` files.
- Do not add real DB URIs, server IPs, credentials, keys, certificates, logs, dumps, or customer screenshots.
- Do not import private repository history.
- Use only synthetic data in `sample-data/`.

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) and [docs/DATA_NOTICE.md](docs/DATA_NOTICE.md).
